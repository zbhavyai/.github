# Security

I take security seriously and will actively work to resolve security issues.

## Reporting a vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please do not open a public issue. Instead, please report it by emailing [zbhavyai@gmail.com](mailto:zbhavyai@gmail.com). I ask that you give me sufficient time to investigate and address the vulnerability before disclosing it publicly.

Please include the following details in your report:

- A description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the vulnerability
- Your assessment of the potential impact
- Any possible mitigations

## Security best practices

While I do my best to secure my project, users are encouraged to implement their own security best practices, such as:

- Regularly updating to the latest version of my project
- Securing access to hosted instances of my project
- Monitoring systems for unusual activity

## Contact

For any other questions or concerns, please contact me at [zbhavyai@gmail.com](mailto:zbhavyai@gmail.com).
